# VIM

Taking this entire vim setup is probably a bad idea. You'll rip
yourself off if you don't learn what all of it does.

All plugin-like things are installed as Git submodules in `bundle/`.
To update individual plguins, cd into it's dir, checkout master,
pull, return to dotfile root dir and commit changes to the submodule.
